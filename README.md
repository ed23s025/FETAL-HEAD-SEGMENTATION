ðŸ§  Fetal Head Segmentation Using U-Net

Overview:
In this project, I used deep learning (U-Net model) to automatically find and outline a babyâ€™s head in ultrasound images. It shows how AI can help doctors analyze medical images more accurately and quickly. The work was done using PyTorch.

Key Highlights:

Tech Used: NumPy, PyTorch, OpenCV, PIL, Pandas

Model: U-Net (a type of deep learning model with 23 layers) designed for precise image segmentation

Image Size: Each image is 572Ã—572 pixels

Accuracy: Reached 95.6% Dice score and 97.4% pixel accuracy

Hardware: Trained on an NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti GPU

Data Used:

Training: 799 images

Validation: 200 images

Testing: 335 images

Data Augmentation: Added random flips and rotations to make the model more robust

Output: The model predicts a binary mask showing the babyâ€™s head area

Training Control: Used early stopping and checkpoints to prevent overfitting and save the best version

Loss Function: Combined Binary Cross Entropy and Dice Loss for better segmentation results

Steps to Use the Project:

Install all required Python libraries.

Prepare and clean ultrasound images.

Train the model using the dataset.

Test the modelâ€™s performance on new images.

Use the trained model to segment fetal heads in unseen ultrasound scans.

What Makes It Useful:
This model helps in automating fetal head detection, which can support doctors in prenatal care by saving time and improving accuracy in ultrasound analysis
